## 🤖 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) & PDF QA

RAG allows students to ask questions and receive AI answers compiled directly from uploaded study materials.

### Setup and PDF processing
1. Upload PDF notes in the Resource Hub.
2. Run the script to extract and chunk the text:
   ```bash
   npm run process-pdfs
   ```
   *This extracts text page-by-page, divides it into ~500-token chunks, and saves them to `document_chunks` table.*
3. Toggle **"Use Internal Resources"** on the AI Assistant page (`/ai-assistant`) to fetch cited answers.
4. Verify resource status via:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/check-resources.ts
   ```

### API Endpoints for RAG
- `POST /api/resources/process` - Processes a single PDF (`resourceId` in body).
- `POST /api/ai/rag-chat` - Main RAG query endpoint (`question`, `useInternalResources` toggle, optional `subject` and `semester`).

## 🎨 Design System & Aesthetics

- **Student & Admin Dashboard**: Warm beige aesthetics with HSL-balanced tones (`Background: #FDFBF9`, `Sidebar/Dock: #F8F3EE`, `Borders: #E8DFD3`, `Buttons: #6B5844`).
- **Mentor Dashboard**: Premium dark navy analytics layout styled after professional dashboard wireframes (gradient banner, stats metric distributions, github activity calendar, custom Recharts graphs, and glassmorphism detail matrices).
- **Layout Modes**: Supports **Bottom Dock** navigation and classic **Side Sidebar** navigation. Toggleable under Settings.
- **Glassmorphism**: Backdrop blur elements with semi-transparent card panels.
- **Security Role Routing**: Next.js middleware guards are active to redirect unauthorized cross-role requests (e.g. students trying to access `/mentor` or `/admin`) back to the homepage login grid automatically.

---

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

- **Microphone Permission**: Allow browser microphone permissions for Voice Navigation. Works best in Chrome/Edge.
- **AI Not Responding**: Check that your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correctly defined in `.env.local`. Test with `npx tsx scripts/test-gemini.ts`.
- **Reset Database**: If tables get out of sync, run `npx prisma migrate reset` to clean and reseed.
